# PART ONE: Write your own function declarations.

# NOTE: We haven't given you function signatures or docstrings for these, so
# you'll need to write your own.

#    (a) Write a function that takes a town name as a string and evaluates to
#        `True` if it is your hometown, and `False` otherwise.

def from_hometown(town):
    """Returns True or False if town is hometown"""

    if town.lower() == "san francisco":

#    (b) Write a function that takes a first and last name as arguments and
#        returns the concatenation of the two names in one string.

def full_name(first_name, last_name):
    """Takes first and last name and returns it as one string"""

    return "{} {}".format(first_name, last_name)

#    (c) Write a function that takes a home town, a first name, and a last name
#        as arguments, calls both functions from part (a) and (b) and prints
#        "Hi, 'full name here', we're from the same place!", or "Hi 'full name
#        here', I'd like to visit 'town name here'!" depending on what the function
#        from part (a) evaluates to.

# PART TWO

#    (a) Write a function, `is_berry()`, which takes a fruit name as a string
#        and returns a boolean if the fruit is a "strawberry", "raspberry", or
#        "blackberry."

#    (b) Write another function, shipping_cost(), which calculates shipping
#        cost by taking a fruit name as a string and calling the `is_berry()`
#        function within the `shipping_cost()` function. Your function should
#        return 0 if is_berry() == True, and 5 if is_berry() == False.

#    (c) Make a function that takes in a number and a list of numbers. It should
#        return a new list containing the elements of the input list, along with
#        given number, which should be at the end of the new list.

#    (d) Write a function calculate_price to calculate an item's total cost by
#        adding tax, and any fees required by state law.

#        Your function will take as parameters (in this order): the base price of
#        the item, a two-letter state abbreviation, and the tax percentage (as a
#        two-digit decimal, so, for instance, 5% will be .05). If the user does not
#        provide a tax rate it should default to 5%.

#        CA law requires stores to collect a 3% recycling fee, PA requires a $2
#        highway safety fee, and in MA, there is a Commonwealth Fund fee of $1 for
#        items with a base price under $100 and $3 for items $100 or more. Fees are
#        added *after* the tax is calculated.

#        Your function should return the total cost of the item, including tax and
#        fees.

# PART THREE: ADVANCED

# NOTE: We haven't given you function signatures and docstrings for these, so
# you'll need to write your own.

#    (a) Make a new function that takes in a list and any number of additional
#        arguments, appends them to the list, and returns the entire list. Hint: this
#        isn't something we've discussed yet in class; you might need to google how to
#        write a Python function that takes in an arbitrary number of arguments.

#    (b) Make a new function with a nested inner function.
#        The outer function will take in a word.
#        The inner function will multiply that word by 3.
#        Then, the outer function will call the inner function.
#        Print the output as a tuple, with the original function argument
#        at index 0 and the result of the inner function at index 1.

#        Example:

#        >>> outer("Balloonicorn")
#        ('Balloonicorn', 'BalloonicornBalloonicornBalloonicorn')
